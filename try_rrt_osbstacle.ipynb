    "RRT Path Planning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for path planning in a 2D environment with obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RRT algorithm is a powerful and widely used method for finding a collision-free path from a start point to a goal point in a complex, high-dimensional space. It works by incrementally building a tree from the start point, randomly exploring the environment, and growing the tree towards these random points.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How RRT Works:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Initialize the Tree:__ The tree starts with just the start node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Iterative Expansion:__ In each iteration, the algorithm does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Sample a Point:__ A random point is sampled from the environment. With a small probability (`GOAL_SAMPLE_RATE`), the goal point is sampled to encourage growth towards the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Find Nearest Node:__ The nearest node in the existing tree to the sampled point is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Steer:__ A new node is created a fixed distance (`STEP_SIZE`) from the nearest node, in the direction of the sampled point.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Collision Check:__ The path from the nearest node to the new node is checked for collisions with obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __Add to Tree:__ If the path is collision-free, the new node is added to the tree, with its parent set to the nearest node.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. __Goal Check:__ After adding the new node, its distance to the goal is checked. If it's within a certain threshold (`GOAL_THRESHOLD`), a path is considered found.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. __Path Reconstruction:__ If a path is found, it is reconstructed by backtracking from the goal node to the start node using the parent pointers."
